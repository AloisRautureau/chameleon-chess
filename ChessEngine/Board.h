/*
 * Board class is used to represent the current position, generate and make moves, and generally speaking modify the board in any meaningful way
 * It does most of the heavy lifting, if you'd like
 *
 * It uses a 0x88 representation, as well as a piece-list, in order to store those informations
 * Other small variables are used to keep information such as side to move etc
