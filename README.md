# chameleon-chess

chameleon-chess is the **chess engine** which will be powering up BAUB-Chess in the near future. The goal is to make it a fully functionnal, decent, and UCI compatible engine, optimized enough to run correctly on a Raspberry Pi.<br/>
It uses a combination of a 0x88 board representation, speed up by keeping a piece-list to avoid scanning it in its entirety.

## TODO

[x] Board Representation<br/>
[x] Evaluation function<br/>
[x] Search function<br/>
[ ] UCI compatibility<br/>
[ ] Deep optimization<br/>
[ ] Opening book<br/>

## How do I use cameleon ?

For now, chameleon only serves as a Perft function, atlhough not a very fast one!
UCI compatibility will be added later on
