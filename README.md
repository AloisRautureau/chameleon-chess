# baub-chess

BAUB-Chess is the entire code needed to bring BAUB, the robotic chess player, to life.
It includes a **chess engine**, and the librairy necessary for him to **interact with the board**.
Most of the code is a combination of C++ and Python code.

## Why ?

BAUB was an idea that came in mind during the recent pandemic, in which I started playing chess, and was in dire need of a programming project.
It was mainly created as a means to learn about the developpement of complex applications using multiple sub-modules all working together in harmony, robotics and electronics.

## How do I use BAUB ?

The chess engine itself can simply be used by cloning the ChessEngine directory, compiling the code and launching the resulting executable.
Another way, when it's ready, will be to test it through a website made specifically for the occasion! It's not yet finished tho.

As for the librairy, a documentation is set in the BoardInteraction directory.
